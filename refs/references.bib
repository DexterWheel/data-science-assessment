    abstract = {Author Summary Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are the molecules that relay the information from genes (DNA) to proteins. Cells contain different amounts of each mRNA type depending on their function and their situation. The quantity of each mRNA depends on the balance between its production (transcription) and its degradation (mRNA decay). Recent studies have shown that the rate at which each mRNA is degraded is specific for every gene, but little is known about how this is regulated. In this work, we look at the role of a class of proteins that bind to RNA molecules (RNA-binding proteins, or RBPs) in the regulation of RNA decay. By systematically examining cells in which a single RBP has been inactivated we identify those that are important for RNA degradation. We found RBPs that make mRNAs more stable (that is, they are degraded more slowly) and others that make them unstable. These RBPs control the RNAs of genes with common features, suggesting that they provide a way of coordinating the function of groups of genes. However, for many genes we did not find RBPs that control their stability, indicating that other players are important to regulate RNA degradation.},

Here we report a proteome-scale study of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe based on cloning of the ORFeome. Taking advantage of a recombination-based cloning system, we obtained 4,910 ORFs in a form that is readily usable in various analyses. First, we evaluated ORF prediction in the fission yeast genome project by expressing each ORF tagged at the 3{\textasciiacutex} terminus. Next, we determined the localization of 4,431 proteins, corresponding to ∼90{\%} of the fission yeast proteome, by tagging each ORF with the yellow fluorescent protein. Furthermore, using leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the nuclear export protein Crm1, we identified 285 proteins whose localization is regulated by Crm1.},

abstract = { Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression is an elaborate and intricate process, constituting an important mechanism for the control of protein expression. During its existence, mRNA is escorted by proteins and other RNAs, which control the maturation, transportation, localization, translational efficiency, and ultimately its degradation. Without changes at the transcription level, mRNA steady-state levels can vary dramatically by just small changes in mRNA stability. By influencing the metabolism of specific mRNAs, the abundance of specific mRNAs can be controlled in organisms from bacteria to mammals. In eukaryotic cells, the control of mRNA stability is exerted through specific cis-acting elements (sequence-specific control elements) and trans-acting factors (mRNA binding proteins and some miRNAs). mRNA stability appears to be a key regulator in controlling the expression of many proteins. Dysregulation of mRNA stability has been associated with human diseases, including cancer, inflammatory disease, and Alzheimer’s. These observations suggest that modulating the stability of specific mRNAs may represent a viable strategy for pharmaceutical intervention. The literature already describes several compounds that influence mRNA stability. Measuring mRNA stability by conventional methods is labor intensive and time-consuming. However, several systems have been described that can be used to screen for modulators of mRNA levels in a high-throughput format. Thus, these assay systems offer a novel approach for screening targets that at present appear to be poorly “drugable.” This review describes the utility of mRNA stability as a novel approach to drug discovery, focusing on assay methods and tool compounds available to monitor mRNA stability. The authors describe mRNA stability assays and issues related to this approach. }

abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2-7), particularly those in 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3'UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the "offset 6mer," to be detected. In total, >45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and >60{\%} of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3' end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2{\%} of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (P(CT)) correlating with experimental measurements of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including conserved 3'-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan website, which displays the P(CT) for each site and each predicted target.},

abstract={Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are longer than 200 nucleotides but often unstable, contribute a substantial and diverse portion to pervasive noncoding transcriptomes. Most lncRNAs are poorly annotated and understood, although several play important roles in gene regulation and diseases. Here we systematically uncover and analyze lncRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Based on RNA-seq data from twelve RNA-processing mutants and nine physiological conditions, we identify 5775 novel lncRNAs, nearly 4{\texttimes} the previously annotated lncRNAs. The expression of most lncRNAs becomes strongly induced under the genetic and physiological perturbations, most notably during late meiosis. Most lncRNAs are cryptic and suppressed by three RNA-processing pathways: the nuclear exosome, cytoplasmic exonuclease, and RNAi. Double-mutant analyses reveal substantial coordination and redundancy among these pathways. We classify lncRNAs by their dominant pathway into cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs), and Dicer-sensitive unstable transcripts (DUTs). XUTs and DUTs are enriched for antisense lncRNAs, while CUTs are often bidirectional and actively translated. The cytoplasmic exonuclease, along with RNAi, dampens the expression of thousands of lncRNAs and mRNAs that become induced during meiosis. Antisense lncRNA expression mostly negatively correlates with sense mRNA expression in the physiological, but not the genetic conditions. Intergenic and bidirectional lncRNAs emerge from nucleosome-depleted regions, upstream of positioned nucleosomes. Our results highlight both similarities and differences to lncRNA regulation in budding yeast. This broad survey of the lncRNA repertoire and characteristics in S. pombe, and the interwoven regulatory pathways that target lncRNAs, provides a rich framework for their further functional analyses.},
