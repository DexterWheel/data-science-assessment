#######Notes#######

Data analysis:

  Main aim: is to eliminate most of the new dataframes that I create
  
  Section 1 (Lines 7-47): Are Essential Genes Expressed Differently to Non-Essential Genes?
  

    T--Lines 17-19: I need to find a way to make essential column into a factor during import, along withconverting any other dodgily defined variables.

    T--Lines 13-23: I isolate just protein coding genes and then remove n.a values (could be piped or make a function to do this)

    T--Lines 25-27: I also turn essentiality into a column. To do this I currently split the essential and non essential data into separate datasets but I can do this without splitting the data
    
    Lines 29-47: The plot can improve visually, needs insertion into RMD and can be made without data from different dataframes. Data from the wilcox tests needs to be quoted in the text of the RMD
    
    
    
  Section 2 (47-80) The relationship between mRNA Stability and RPKM in Essential and Non-Essential mRNAs
  
  
    Lines 47-80: Not a lot wrong, just needs to be inserted and potentially merge the two plots. Data from the wilcox tests needs to be quoted in the text of the RMD
    
    
    
  Section 3: The Relationship Between mRNA Stability and Localisation in Essential and Non-Essential mRNAs
  
  
    T--Lines 84-113: Localisation data needs to be made into a single variable with new names (wrkshp 2mutate function), could be done with one pipe and without the creation of new dataframes
