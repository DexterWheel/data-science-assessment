Aims::

The aim is to recode the old project

Repeat some of the old analyses with more localisations in the hope of capturing more data points.

Carry out new analyses with the dataset. Machine learning?

Bonus: hopefully I can find ways to incorporate the writing of functions, even if it mean reverse engineering an already existing command more crudely.

I won't neccessarily go fully in depth in the discussion of the new results as the marks are not based on the quality of the science
